    <section id="main" name="Building Apache log4net&#x2122;">
      <p>
        The log4net release builds are built using zarro. Log4net can also be built
        using Visual Studio.
      </p>

      <section id="vsnet" name="Visual Studio">
        <p>
          Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 are supported build platforms for log4net.
        </p>

        <section id="vs" name="Visual Studio">
          <p>
            The log4net distribution includes a solution and project file
            for Visual Studio. Open the <span class="code">log4net.sln</span>
            from the src directory in the distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The log4net project requires only the following references:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>System</li>
            <li>System.Configuration</li>
            <li>System.Data</li>
            <li>System.Web</li>
            <li>System.XML</li>
          </ul>

            Sandcastle
            Helpfile Builder
          </a> is used to build the log4net SDK
          documentation.  Running it is currently not
          integrated with the NAnt build process, you'll
          have to open and run <code>log4net.shfbproj</code>
          with SHFB manually.
